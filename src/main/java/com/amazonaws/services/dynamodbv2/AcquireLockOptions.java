         * user-provided callback when the lock is about to expire. The advantage
         * this provides is notification that your lock is about to expire before it
         * is actually expired, and in case of leader election will help in
         * preventing that there are no two leaders present simultaneously.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * If due to any reason heartbeating is unsuccessful for a configurable
         * period of time, your lock enters into a phase known as "danger zone." It
         * is during this "danger zone" that the callback will be run. It is also
         * during this period that a call to lockItem.amIAboutToExpire() will return
         * <code>true</code> and your application can take appropriate measures.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * Bear in mind that the callback on a SessionMonitor may be null. In this
         * case, no callback will be run upon the lock entering the "danger zone";
         * yet, one can still make use of the amIAboutToExpire() method.
         * Furthermore, non-null callbacks can only ever be executed once in a
         * lock's lifetime. Independent of whether or not a callback is run, the
         * client will attempt to heartbeat the lock until the lock is released or
         * obtained by someone else.
